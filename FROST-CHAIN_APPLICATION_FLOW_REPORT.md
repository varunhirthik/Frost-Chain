## Complete Application Flow: From Startup to End

### Phase 1: Development Environment Setup

#### Step 1: Local Blockchain Initialization
```bash
# Start local Hardhat blockchain node
npx hardhat node
```
**What happens:**
- Hardhat creates a local Ethereum blockchain on `http://127.0.0.1:8545`
- Network Chain ID: `31337` (0x7a69 in hex)
- Provides 20 test accounts with 10,000 ETH each
- Enables fast mining (instant transactions for testing)

#### Step 2: Smart Contract Compilation & Deployment
```bash
# Compile Solidity contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

**Deployment Process (`scripts/deploy.js`):**
1. **Pre-deployment Checks**:
   - Validates deployer account balance
   - Estimates gas costs
   - Calculates deployment expenses

2. **Contract Deployment**:
   - Deploys `Traceability.sol` contract
   - Contract receives address (e.g., `0xe7f1725E7734CE288F8367e1Bb143E90bb3F0512`)
   - Deployer automatically gets `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and `PROCESSOR_ROLE`

3. **Post-deployment Validation**:
   - Verifies contract bytecode exists
   - Confirms initial roles are assigned
   - Validates initial state (batch count = 0)
   - Saves deployment info to `deployments/localhost-deployment.json`

### Phase 2: MetaMask Wallet Integration

#### Step 3: MetaMask Network Configuration
**User Action Required:**
1. Install MetaMask browser extension
2. Add Localhost 8545 network:
   - **Network Name**: Localhost 8545
   - **RPC URL**: http://127.0.0.1:8545
   - **Chain ID**: 31337
   - **Currency Symbol**: ETH

3. Import test account private key from Hardhat node output

#### Step 4: Frontend Application Startup
```bash
# Install frontend dependencies
cd frontend && npm install

# Start React development server
npm start
```

**Frontend Initialization (`App.js`):**
- Starts React app on `http://localhost:3000`
- Initializes routing with React Router
- Sets up context providers:
  - `BlockchainProvider`: Manages wallet connection and contract interaction
  - `RoleProvider`: Handles user role management

### Phase 3: Wallet Connection & Authentication

#### Step 5: Automatic Wallet Detection
**Frontend Process (`BlockchainContext.js`):**
1. **Connection Check**: App checks if MetaMask is already connected
2. **Auto-Connect**: If previous connection exists, automatically reconnects
3. **Network Validation**: Ensures user is on correct network (Chain ID 31337)
4. **Provider Setup**: Creates Ethers.js provider and signer
5. **Contract Binding**: Connects to deployed contract using address and ABI

#### Step 6: Role-Based Access Control
**Smart Contract Roles (`Traceability.sol`):**
- **DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE**: Can grant/revoke all roles, emergency functions
- **PROCESSOR_ROLE**: Can create batches, add trace events
- **DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE**: Can receive batches, add logistics updates
- **RETAILER_ROLE**: Can receive final batches, mark as delivered
- **ORACLE_ROLE**: Can submit temperature readings from IoT devices

### Phase 4: Supply Chain Operations

#### Step 7: Batch Creation (Processor)
**User Interface (`CreateBatch.js`):**
1. Processor navigates to "Create Batch" page
2. Fills form with:
   - Product name (e.g., "Frozen Chicken Breasts")
   - Additional details (lot number, processing date, etc.)

**Smart Contract Execution:**
```javascript
function createBatch(string memory _productName, string memory _additionalDetails)
```
- Generates unique batch ID using counter
- Creates `ProductBatch` struct with:
  - Creation timestamp
  - Processor address
  - Initial status: `CREATED`
  - Temperature: Safe (-18°C)
- Emits `BatchEventLog` event for immutable record

#### Step 8: Temperature Monitoring & Trace Events
**Continuous Monitoring:**
Users (current batch owner) or oracles can add temperature readings:

```javascript
function addTraceEvent(uint256 _batchId, string memory _location, int256 _temperature, string memory _additionalNotes)
```

**Temperature Breach Detection:**
- **Safe Threshold**: -18°C
- **Automatic Compromise**: If temperature > -18°C:
  - Batch marked as `COMPROMISED`
  - Status changed to `BatchStatus.COMPROMISED`
  - Alert event emitted
  - Visual warnings in frontend

#### Step 9: Ownership Transfer (Supply Chain Handover)
**Transfer Process:**
1. Current owner initiates transfer to next party
2. Smart contract validates:
   - Caller is current owner
   - New owner address is valid
   - New owner has appropriate role

```javascript
function transferOwnership(uint256 _batchId, address _newOwner, string memory _handoverNotes)
```

**Status Updates:**
- Transfer to `DISTRIBUTOR_ROLE` → Status: `IN_TRANSIT`
- Transfer to `RETAILER_ROLE` → Status: `DELIVERED`

### Phase 5: Real-time Monitoring & Analytics

#### Step 10: Dashboard Analytics (`Dashboard.js`)
**Real-time Statistics:**
- Total batches in system
- Number of compromised batches
- User-specific batch count
- Recent batch activities

**Data Sources:**
- Smart contract events (efficient gas usage)
- Current batch states
- User role permissions

#### Step 11: Batch History & Traceability (`BatchHistory.js`)
**Complete Audit Trail:**
- Chronological event timeline
- Temperature history graphs
- Ownership transfer records
- Geographic location tracking
- Compromise alerts and reasons

### Phase 6: Administrative Functions

#### Step 12: Role Management (`AdminPanel.js`)
**Admin-only Functions:**
- Grant roles to supply chain participants
- Emergency batch compromise marking
- System-wide monitoring
- User permission management

**Role Assignment Process:**
```javascript
function grantMultipleRoles(address _account, bytes32[] memory _roles)
```

### Phase 7: Advanced Features

#### Step 13: Oracle Integration (IoT Sensors)
**Automated Data Feed:**
```javascript
function submitOracleReadings(uint256 _batchId, int256[] memory _readings, string[] memory _locations, uint256[] memory _timestamps)
```
- Batch temperature readings from IoT sensors
- Automated compromise detection
- Real-world supply chain integration

#### Step 14: Emergency Protocols
**Emergency Functions:**
- Immediate batch compromise marking
- Supply chain alert system
- Regulatory compliance reporting
