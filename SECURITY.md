- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### 3. What to expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

- **Resolution Timeline**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days, and other vulnerabilities within 90 days.
- **Credit**: We will credit you for the discovery in our security advisory unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Smart Contract Security

Our smart contracts undergo regular security reviews:

- **Access Control**: We use OpenZeppelin's AccessControl for role-based permissions
- **Reentrancy Protection**: All state-changing functions are protected against reentrancy attacks
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Gas Optimization**: Contracts are optimized to prevent gas limit issues
- **Emergency Controls**: Emergency pause functionality for critical situations

## Frontend Security

- **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Secure Communication**: All blockchain interactions use secure RPC endpoints
- **Wallet Security**: MetaMask integration follows best practices
- **State Management**: Secure state management with proper validation

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

2. **Investigation**: Our team investigates and develops fixes
3. **Patch Development**: Security patches are developed and tested
4. **Coordinated Release**: Patches are released with security advisories
5. **Public Disclosure**: Full details are disclosed after patches are deployed

## Bug Bounty Program

We may offer rewards for significant security vulnerabilities:

- **Critical**: $500 - $2000 (remote code execution, contract fund theft)
- **High**: $100 - $500 (privilege escalation, significant data exposure)
- **Medium**: $50 - $100 (authentication bypass, lesser data exposure)
- **Low**: $10 - $50 (information disclosure, minor issues)

Rewards are at our discretion and depend on:
- Severity of the vulnerability
- Quality of the report
- Reproducibility of the issue
- Impact on users and the system

## Security Best Practices for Users
